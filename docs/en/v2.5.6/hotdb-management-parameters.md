| 64 | Database  features | prefetchValidTimeout | The  valid timeout time of prefetch(seconds) | Y | The  valid timeout time of prefetching the auto-incremental batch. When set as 0,  it means that the auto-incremental batch is not abandoned due to the timeout.  For example, if 30 seconds is set, the prefetch range is 1-100.
